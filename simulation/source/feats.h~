/*
The program simulates the behavior of the zebrafish segmentation clock for two cells,
through a matematical model using delay differential equations.
To solve the equations, the program uses Euler's method, with an adjustable stepsize.
The program tries to find parameter sets which replicate the behavior of the system in wild type
and several mutants.
